# Node-Crawler
**Project for using HTTP knowledge - FreeCodeCamp course**

This program can crawl a website and list all the links in its html code.

Node-Crawler recursively crawls all the webpages within that website and
skips any duplicate or external link. Then it will print out a sorted list
containing the links and how many times they were used in the website.
